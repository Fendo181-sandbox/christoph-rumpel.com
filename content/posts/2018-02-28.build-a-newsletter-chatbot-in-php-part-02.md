# Storing subscriptions

You probably have noticed that we aren't storing any information yet. Yes, you're right :-) So let's do that.
<br /><br />
What we want is a users table, where we can see who has already subscribed to the newsletter. Laravel comes with a basic user migration file. We can edit `database/migrations/..._create_users_table.php` and add the Facebook user data. Depending on the user's permissions, not all values are accessible. We make this values `nullable`.

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->increments('id');
        $table->string('fb_id');
        $table->string('first_name');
        $table->string('last_name');
        $table->string('profile_pic')->nullable();
        $table->string('locale', 8)->nullable();
        $table->string('gender')->nullable();
        $table->boolean('subscribed')->default(false);
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```

Now create the table with `php artisan migrate`. 

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you have already setup your database in your .env file, to make this work.</div>

With that done, we need a place where we add the users. For this purpose, I'd like to use a BotMan middleware. Like a Laravel middleware, it lets us perform tasks, at certain points of the request cycle. For all incoming messages, I want to add or update a user. We can use the BotMan `Heard Middleware` for that. It will be called every time a message was matched by a listener. <br /><br />
Create the `SaveUserMiddleware.php` file inside `App\Http\Middleware`. Here is the code.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use App\User;
use BotMan\BotMan\BotMan;
use BotMan\BotMan\Interfaces\Middleware\Heard;
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Incoming\IncomingMessage;

class SaveUserMiddleware implements Heard
{
    public function heard(IncomingMessage $message, $next, BotMan $bot)
    {
        $user = $bot->getUser();

        if($user instanceof \BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\User) {
            User::createFromIncomingMessage($user);
        }

        return $next($message);
    }
}
```

Inside the `heard` method we grab the BotMan user object and put it inside a user model method. We need to check if the message is from Facebook Messenger, because we are going to store specific Facebook values. To accomplish it we could check the matched BotMan driver,or like we did, check the user object. Every driver has their own user class.
<br /><br />
And in the `App/User.php` user model, we update or create the user.

```php
public static function createFromIncomingMessage(\BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\User $user)
{
    User::updateOrCreate(['fb_id' => $user->getId()], [
		'fb_id' => $user->getId(),
		'first_name' => $user->getFirstName(),
		'last_name' => $user->getLastName(),
		'profile_pic' => $user->getProfilePic(),
		'locale' => $user->getLocale(),
		'gender' => $user->getGender(),
	]);
}
```

Also make sure to update the fillable array of the user class. Only these values are allowed to be stored.

```php
protected $fillable = [
	'fb_id',
	'first_name',
	'last_name',
	'profile_pic',
	'gender',
	'locale',
];
```

Last step here is to add the middleware in our `botman.php` file. Place it above the `hears` listeners.

```php
$middleware = new SaveUserMiddleware();
$botman->middleware->heard($middleware);
```

Don't forget to set the additional namespace `use App\Http\Middleware\SaveUserMiddleware;`.
<br /><br />

Give it a try. Type "subscribe" in the chat and with a little luck, you should get a reply and new user entry in your database.

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing the new user in the database" src="/images/blog/nl_bot_database.png" />

If not, check your logs for errors. If your app is responding to Facebook with a 500 error, make sure to uncomment the lines responsible for it immediately. This is important because Facebook will send, in case of an error, the message again and again. The sooner your application responds with a 200 code, the better it is. You can debug afterwards.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> Facebook sometimes blocks your app for several minutes if it receives too many errors from your application.</div>

Now that we have the users in our database we want to be able to subscribe and unsubscribe them. This is what the boolean `subscribed` field in the users table is for. I will use two more user model methods to fill it.

```php
/**
 * Subscribe user to newsletter
 *
 * @param string $facebookId
 */
public static function subscribe(string $facebookId)
{
    $user = User::where('fb_id', $facebookId)
        ->first();

    if ($user) {
        $user->subscribed = true;
        $user->save();
    }
}

/**
 * Unsubscribe user from newsletter
 *
 * @param string $facebookId
 */
public static function unsubscribe(string $facebookId)
{
    $user = User::where('fb_id', $facebookId)
        ->first();

    if ($user) {
        $user->subscribed = false;
        $user->save();
    }
}
```

Nothing special here. We are just checking to see if the user exists and then change the subscription boolean. We can now add those methods to our subscription conversation.

```php
if ($answer->getValue() === 'yes') {
    User::subscribe($answer->getMessage()->getSender()); // new
    $this->bot->reply('Woohoo, great to have you on board! 🎉');
    $this->bot->reply('I will message you when there is something new to tell ✌️');
} else {
    User::unsubscribe($answer->getMessage()->getSender()); // new
    $this->bot->reply('Ok no problem. If change your mind, just type "subscribe".');
}
```
You will also need to import the new user class `use App\User;` at the top of the file.
And again please try it out yourself. When you subscribe, you should see that in the user table in your database.

## Extras

### Typing indicator
Essentially, we are almost done. Just two more things I want to add. First, you have probably noticed that the bot's messages pop in very fast. This is a problem when your text gets longer and the user needs more time to read. In Facebook, there is a `typing indicator` which you probably already know. It shows some animated bubbles, that tell you that the other chat member is typing right now. This is possible with bots as well with the `typesAndWaits` method in BotMan. It shows the typing indicator and waits for the desired time before moving on. This is exactly what we need.
<br /><br />
These are the conversation methods with the new additions:

```php
private function welcome()
{
    $this->bot->typesAndWaits(.5);
    $this->bot->reply('Hey and welcome! 👋');

    $this->askAboutSubscription();
}

private function askAboutSubscription()
{
    $this->bot->typesAndWaits(.5);
    $this->bot->reply('I help Christoph to spread some news about his book development. 📘');
    $this->bot->typesAndWaits(1);
    $this->bot->reply('If you like, I can keep you updated about it here on Facebook Messenger.');
    $this->bot->typesAndWaits(1);

    $question = Question::create('Are you in?')
        ->addButtons([
            Button::create('Yes please')
                ->value('yes'),
            Button::create('Nope')
                ->value('no'),
        ]);

    $this->ask($question, function (Answer $answer) {
        if ($answer->getValue() === 'yes') {
            User::subscribe($answer->getMessage()->getSender());
            $this->bot->reply('Woohoo, great to have you on board! 🎉');
            $this->bot->typesAndWaits(.5);
            $this->bot->reply('I will message you when there is something new to tell ✌️');
            $this->bot->typesAndWaits(.5);
        } else {
            User::unsubscribe($answer->getMessage()->getSender());
            $this->bot->typesAndWaits(1);
            $this->bot->reply('Ok no problem. If change your mind, just type "subscribe".');
        }

        $this->bot->typesAndWaits(1);
        $this->bot->reply("Christoph also likes to blog a lot. Make sure to check out his site for more chatbot stuff: \n ✨ https://christoph-rumpel.com/ ✨ ");
        $this->bot->typesAndWaits(1);
        $this->bot->reply('See you! 👋');
    });
}
```

### Fallback

Another great little BotMan feature is the `fallback` method. For all incoming messages, that don't match your listeners, you can define some actions as well. I like to tell the user about what the bot can in order to help him with the next steps. Place it into your `routes/botman.php` file. The whole file now looks like this:

```php
<?php

use BotMan\BotMan\BotMan;
use App\Http\Middleware\SaveUserMiddleware;
use App\Http\Conversations\SubscribeConversation;
use BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\ButtonTemplate;
use BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\ElementButton;

$botman = resolve('botman');

$middleware = new SaveUserMiddleware();
$botman->middleware->heard($middleware);

$botman->hears('GET_STARTED|subscribe', function (BotMan $bot) {
    $userFromStartButton = $bot->getMessage()->getText() === 'GET_STARTED' ? true : false;
    $bot->startConversation(new SubscribeConversation($userFromStartButton));
});

$botman->fallback(function(BotMan $bot) {
    $bot->reply('Hey!');
    $bot->typesAndWaits(1);
    $bot->reply('I see those words of yours, but I have no idea what they mean. 🤔');
    $bot->typesAndWaits(1);
    $bot->reply('Christoph said I need to focus on telling you about his book development for now. Maybe later he will train me to understand your messages as well. I hope so ☺️');

    $bot->typesAndWaits(1);

    $question = ButtonTemplate::create('Here is how I can help you:')->addButtons([
        ElementButton::create('💌 Edit subscription')->type('postback')->payload('subscribe'),
        ElementButton::create('👉 Christoph\'s Blog')->url('https://christoph-rumpel.com/')
    ]);

    $bot->reply($question);

});
```

Don't just reply with `Sorry I don't understand your message`. Give the user opportunities and help to move one. In my case, I tell them how to edit their subscription and where they can find more chatbot stuff of mine.

## Sending newsletters

### Requirements

Until now, we got everything set up to welcome users and to sign them in. Obviously, we are not done yet. We also want to send the users little messages about my book from time to time. It is no problem to send messages to users when they start a conversation with your bot. But sending replies, 24 hours after the last conversation, is not allowed. You must apply for the `pages_messaging_subscriptions` permission, to make that possible. Go to your Messenger settings and submit your Facebook App for a review, including pages_messaging_subscriptions.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> Find more details on the process <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy/policy-overview#subscription_messaging">here</a>.</div>

For testing purposes you don't need that. So for now, we're just fine without it.

### Originating messages

Normally, this is the message flow: The user sends something, the bot replies. This is the same with the `get_started` button on Facebook. Here the button triggers the first "message", to which the bot replies. But with our newsletter bot, we want the bot to make the first step. In BotMan terms, this is called `originating messages`. This is an example of the BotMan documentation.

```php
$botman->say('Message', 'my-recipient-user-id', TelegramDriver::class);
```

It looks very similar to what we already know. The only difference is, that we provide the `say` method with a user ID and a driver name. I like to create a Laravel command and to place this code there. It gives me more freedom on how to trigger the message later, like with a cronjob.

```bash
php artisan make:command SendOutNewsletter
```

This creates a new command class in `/app/Console/Commands/`. There we can define a signature and a description.

```php
protected $signature = 'newsletter:send';

protected $description = 'Send newsletter to all subscribers';
```

The description, you will see when you list all the artisan commands. The signature defines the command to run this code. In our case, it will be `php artisan newsletter:send`. But first, we need to place our code in the `handle` method. Here is the whole file.
```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use App\User;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\FacebookDriver;

class SendOutNewsletter extends Command
{
    /**
     * The name and signature of the console command.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $signature = 'newsletter:send';


    /**
     * The console command description.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $description = 'Send newsletter to all subscribers';

    /**
     * Create a new command instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    /**
     * Execute the console command.
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        // init botman
        $botman = app('botman');

        $users = User::where('subscribed', true)->get();

        $users->each(function ($user) use ($botman){
            try {
                $botman->say('Hey ' .$user->first_name.' ...', $user->fb_id, FacebookDriver::class);
            } catch (\Exception $e) {
                $this->info('FAIL sending message to '.$user->fb_id);
                $this->info($e->getCode().': '.$e->getMessage());
            }
        });

        $this->info('Success.');
    }
}
```

First, the botman instance is resolved from the service container. Then we grab all the subscribed users from the database, in order to loop over them. We now send each user a message. The content is totally up to you of course. You can send just one message or multiple ones with different templates as well. For this example, one message is enough. You probably also noticed that we can personalize the messages with the name from the user table.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to only provide helpful content to the user when originating messages. We don't want to create another spam channel here.</div>

Run this command with `php artisan newsletter:send` and there should be a new message in your chat. Congratulations, you just sent your first messenger newsletter.

## BotMan Tests

As good PHP developers, we always think about good ways to test our application. The sames goes for chatbots. But we haven't written any test yet. Especially when building chatbots is still new to you, I think it is better to concentrate on the implementation first. But I don't want to leave you without creating any tests. This is why we will add some basic tests now.
<br /><br />
Actually testing chatbots is quite different from other web applications. With chats we have lots of conversations and text to test. When the user says this, we assert that reply and so on. Let's start with the fallback test.

## Fallback Test

Under `tests/BotMan` you will find a basic BotMan example test. Here you can see how we test a chatbot. First we define the message the bot receives and then we set what we expect as reply.

```php
public function testBasicTest()
{
	$this->bot
		->receives('Hi')
		->assertReply('Hello!');
}
```

Copy the example test file and name the file and class `FallbackTest`. Remove the given code and replace it with this:
```php
<?php

namespace Tests\BotMan;

use Tests\TestCase;
use BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\ElementButton;
use BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\ButtonTemplate;

class FallbackTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * @return void
     * @test
     */
    public function it_triggers_the_fallback_message()
    {
        $this->bot->receives('What is your name?')
            ->assertReply('Hey!')
            ->assertReply('I see those words of yours, but I have no idea what they mean. 🤔')
            ->assertReply('Christoph said I need to focus on telling you about his book development for now. Maybe later he will train me to understand your messages as well. I hope so ☺️');

        $template = ButtonTemplate::create('Here is how I can help you:')->addButtons([
            ElementButton::create('💌 Edit subscription')->type('postback')->payload('subscribe'),
            ElementButton::create('👉 Christoph\'s Blog')->url('https://christoph-rumpel.com/')
        ]);

        $this->bot->assertTemplate($template, true);
    }
}

```

The bot doesn't know what `What is your name?` means. We haven't implemented it yet, so the fallback message is triggered. Since we return multiple messages in the fallback method, we can also check for multiple ones. This is why we can use multiple `assertReply` methods. This is great for basic test messages. But for template messages we need to check the template with `assertTemplate`. Now run the test with:

 ```bash 
phpunit tests/BotMan/FallbackTest.php
 ```

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing the result of the Fallback test" src="/images/blog/nl_fallback_test.png" />

Everything should be green.

## Subscription Conversation Test

Now we move on the subscription process. Create another test file and name it `SubscribeConversationTest.php`. We will create three tests here. First one, is for the welcome message.

```php
/**
 * @test
 */
public function it_welcomes_user_at_start()
{
	$this->bot->receives('GET_STARTED')
		->assertReply('Hey and welcome! 👋')
		->assertReply('I help Christoph to spread some news about his book development. 📘');
}
```

The bot receives the get_started button payload `GET_STARTED` and we assert two replies. Essentially, the bot sends more than these two replies. But for this test, it's just fine. I want to keep this test as simple as possible. Run it with:

```bash
phpunit tests/BotMan/SubscribeConversationTest.php
```

Besides, we can trigger the other messages with the `subscribe` keyword as well. First we take care of the subscribe process with a positive answer.

```php
/**
 * @test
 **/
public function it_subscribes_a_user()
{
	$this->bot->receives('subscribe')
		->assertReply('I help Christoph to spread some news about his book development. 📘')
		->assertReply('If you like, I can keep you updated about it here on Facebook Messenger.')
		->assertQuestion('Are you in?')
		->receives('yes')
		->assertReply('Woohoo, great to have you on board! 🎉')
		->assertReply('I will message you when there is something new to tell ✌️')
		->assertReply("Christoph also likes to blog a lot. Make sure to check out his site for more chatbot stuff: \n ✨ https://christoph-rumpel.com/ ✨ ")
		->assertReply('See you! 👋');
}
```
Here we listen for the subscribe message, then assert some messages as well as a question. Additionally, we chain another incoming user message and assert the rest of the replies. `yes` is the value of our `Yes please` button. We can just use it as a trigger for the other messages. In order to test the negative reply, let's create another test method.

```php
/**
 * @test
 **/
public function it_unsubscribes_a_user()
{
	$this->bot->receives('subscribe')
		->assertReply('I help Christoph to spread some news about his book development. 📘')
		->assertReply('If you like, I can keep you updated about it here on Facebook Messenger.')
		->assertQuestion('Are you in?')
		->receives('no')
		->assertReply('Ok no problem. If change your mind, just type "subscribe".')
		->assertReply("Christoph also likes to blog a lot. Make sure to check out his site for more chatbot stuff: \n ✨ https://christoph-rumpel.com/ ✨ ")
		->assertReply('See you! 👋');
}
```

It's basically the same, just with the users's negative response and our replies for this case. Now, run the tests again and everything should be green as well.

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing the result of the subscription conversation test" src="/images/blog/nl_subscription_test.png" />

As you have probably noticed, we had to duplicate the beginning of the subscribe conversation. This is something that bothers me a lot and I am already figuring out with Marcel how to create a better solution. Still, these few tests are very helpful and good examples.

## Conclusion

We are done! Wow, that was quite a journey. I'm glad I could show you a new and real chatbot use case of mine. We covered everything from planning the bot to implementing and testing it. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and it helps you for your next messenger newsletter.
