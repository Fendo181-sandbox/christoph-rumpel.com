title: How I redesigned my blog and moved it from Jekyll to Laravel
category: laravel
summary: One of my resolutions for 2017 was to redesign my blog. One week before the new year I faced myself with the challenge and thought to myself if this is still doable. Somehow I managed it and here it is. In this article I will explain the process and show you how I redesigned the blog with Tailwind CSS and moved it from Jekyll to Laravel with keeping almost the same performance.

## How to start

<div class="note"><span class="font-bold">Note: </span>Impatient people can find the new blog <a href="https://christoph-rumpel.com">here</a> and the source code <a href="https://github.com/christophrumpel/christoph-rumpel.com">here</a>.</div>

So where do you start when you want to redesign your blog? What I did was a list with things I wanted to change:

* fresh design update
* HTTPS
* moving away from Jekyll

Let's take a short look at each of them

### Fresh design update

My old blog design was from 2014. I created it by myself and was very happy with it for a long time. It was super clean, simple and everything was about the content without any distractions. But there where two problems. First it was quite old and I wanted a fresh and modern touch with new colors.

Second it was never planned to use a menu. Last year I started doing more talks and I wanted to list them on the site too. So I ended up with this temporary menu on the top. It worked but it didn't like it that much.

### HTTPS

Since Chrome is treating sites without HTTPS as `unsecure` you really should use a secure connection. I am not sure if this is still a problem but in the past it wasn't possible to use a GitHub Page with your custom domain and HTTPS.

### Moving away from Jekyll

Jekyll is a great tool and as a static site generator it is super fast! But I didn't like the fact that I need Ruby to use it and I wasn't that big fan of the syntax. Since I use Laravel a lot I always thought about using something more `laravellike`. Is this even a word? Guess now it is!

So the plan was to checkout [Jigsaw](http://jigsaw.tighten.co/), a static site generator using Laravel Blade similar syntax. But I also talked to some people and Freek mentioned that one of his colleagues has a nice solution I should check. He was talking about Sebastian De Deyne and [his blog](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/). I was really fascinated about the used stack and how fast it was. So I decided to give it a try.

## The backend stack

First I want to mention that my blog's backend is heavily inspired by the one from [Sebastian De Deyne](https://github.com/sebastiandedeyne/sebastiandedeyne.com). So thanks a lot for sharing Sebastian and give him some applause 👏 on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sebdedeyne)! :-)

* Laravel
* Markdown articles
* YAML Front Matter parser
* Markdown parser

### Laravel
So the base is a brand new Laravel 5.5 application. Routes are used to connect the endpoints with controllers and Blade is used to structure the layouts and show the content. Pretty basic Laravel stuff.

```php
Route::feeds();
Route::get('/', 'HomeController@index')->name('home');
Route::get('/talks', 'TalksController@index')->name('talks');
Route::get('/{year}/{month}/{slug}', 'PostsController@show')->name('posts.show');
```

### Markdown articles

My articles are stored as Markdown files. This was a must-have for me because I didn't want to change all the old ones. I really like having my articles in Markdown. It is easy to write and you're not distracted by a fancy UI.

### YAML 

```php
private function gather()
    {
        return collect($this->disk->files('posts'))
            ->filter(function ($path) {
                return ends_with($path, '.md');
            })
            ->map(function ($path) {
                $filename = str_after($path, 'posts/');
                [$date, $slug, $extension] = explode('.', $filename, 3);
                $date = Carbon::createFromFormat('Y-m-d', $date);
                $document = YamlFrontMatter::parse($this->disk->get($path));

                return (object) [
                    'path' => $path,
                    'date' => $date,
                    'slug' => $slug,
                    'url' => route('posts.show', [$date->format('Y'), $date->format('m'), $slug]),
                    'external_url' => $document->external_url ?? false,
                    'title' => $document->title,
                    'category' => $document->category ?? 'general',
                    'contents' => markdown($document->body()),
                    'summary' => markdown($document->summary ?? $document->body()),
                    'summary_short' => mb_strimwidth($document->summary ?? $document->body(), 0, 140, "..."),
                    'preview_image' => $document->preview_image ? 'https://christoph-rumpel.com/'.$document->preview_image : 'https://christoph-rumpel.com/images/cr_image_v2.jpg',
                ];
            })
            ->sortByDesc('date');
    }
```

This is quite some code but basically this is what happens here:

* .md files are loaded from the disk
* The file name is split to get the date and the slug of the article. (e.g. 2017-12-31.my-coding-year-2017.md)
* Article content is parsed to get the meta data and the body
* An Object is being created from the given article data

Quite interesting is this line:

````php
$document = YamlFrontMatter::parse($this->disk->get($path));
````

Here the [Spatie yam-front-matter package](https://github.com/spatie/yaml-front-matter) is used to parse the markdown file. 

> YFM is an optional section of valid YAML that is placed at the top of a page and is used for maintaining metadata for the page and its contents.

It is just some meta data that you can use and looks like this.

```yaml
---
title: "My coding year 2017"
category: general
summary: "Another year has come to an end and it is time for my traditional New Year's Eve blog post. I want to take some minutes to think back about the last 12 months and how they changed me as a developer."
---
```

I used something similar on my old blog with Jekyll. Here I also store my article's summary and a cateogory type but it is totally up to you. `$dodcument` is now an object containing all the meta data. Additionally every thing else of the file (after the meta data) is stored in `$document->body()`. So this is actually our Markdown article. We now also need to parse that.

```php
'contents' => markdown($document->body()),
```
This `markdown` helper function then uses the [Markdown parser](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark) by the PHP League to create HTML.

```php
function markdown($markdown)
{
    return app(CommonMarkConverter::class)->convertToHtml($markdown);
}
```

At the end we just sort the articles by date and now we have our post objects. They get also cached which you don't see in this example. This is like the core of the system. The other parts are quite simple. There are some routes to connect the sites and Blade layouts to show the content.

## Toughest decisions are the ones about design

- including fonts
- favicons http://www.favicomatic.com/done


## Where to go from Jekyll

- markdown file adaption
- no abouts, talks missing
- feed

## Make it fast

- screenshots / improvements
- tailwind css shrink

## Thoughts on Tailwind CSS

- not sure if i would use it in a company already
- like the way to style and the config
- problem to know where you use what utility
