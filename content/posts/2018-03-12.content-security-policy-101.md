- security is really HARD (even playstation got hacked)
- you can loose at lof money
- Frontend is safe right? NOT!
- Samy Kamkar XSS Example
- owsap.org good xss resource
- CSP whitelist to tell the browser where to download resources
- define websockets possible too
- downsides: csp header from gmail is BIG, hard to maintain
	- Amazon S3 didn't support it

talk Content Security Policies: Let's Break Stuff - Matt Brunt - PHPSW: Security in Web Applications

- XSS
	- enables attacker to inject client side scripts "non-malicious" web page
	- 52% of all website vulnerabilities
	- Example attack: Twitter self-retweeting tweet
	- different types of CSS
		- stored XSS
		- reflected XSS
		- DOM Based XSS
		- SELF XSS
- CSP
	- http response headers
	- no silverbullet
	- another tool
	- declare what resources are allowed to load
	- browser support
	- can protect
		- default-src
		- script-src
		- style-src
		- img-src
		- form-action
		- update-insecure-requests
	- none
		- dont trust anyone
	- self
		- same scheme, host and port
	- *
		- all except data
	- inline
	- unsafe-inline
		- dont use it (unsafe)
	- nonce
		- when to use it??
	- report URI --> report-uri.io
	- report-only mode
	- example app to test it, first default nothing is shown there
	- new directive coming: trust this site and everything they load

MDN:
- xss vs data injection attacks
- CSP fully backward compatibility except CSP v2)
- brwosers ignore it
- if no CSP brwoser likewise use standard same-origin policy
- X-Content-Security-Policy is and older version of th header
- meta tag can be used to configure CSP
- CSP can also say which protocol to use like HTTPS
- a directive  describes the policy for a certain resource type
- a default-src directive should be added as fallback
- self includes subdomains
