## BotMan Tests

As good PHP developers, we always think about good ways to test our application. The sames goes for chatbots. But we haven't written any test yet. Especially when building chatbots is still new to you, I think it is better to concentrate on the implementation first. But I don't want to leave you without creating any tests. This is why we will add some basic tests now.
<br /><br />
Actually testing chatbots is quite different from other web applications. With chats we have lots of conversations and text to test. When the user says this, we assert that reply and so on. Let's start with the fallback test.

## Fallback Test

Under `tests/BotMan` you will find a basic BotMan example test. Here you can see how we test a chatbot. First we define the message the bot receives and then we set what we expect as reply.

```php
public function testBasicTest()
{
	$this->bot
		->receives('Hi')
		->assertReply('Hello!');
}
```

Copy the example test file and name the file and class `FallbackTest`. Remove the given code and replace it with this:
```php
<?php

namespace Tests\BotMan;

use Tests\TestCase;
use BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\ElementButton;
use BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\ButtonTemplate;

class FallbackTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * @return void
     * @test
     */
    public function it_triggers_the_fallback_message()
    {
        $this->bot->receives('What is your name?')
            ->assertReply('Hey!')
            ->assertReply('I see those words of yours, but I have no idea what they mean. 🤔')
            ->assertReply('Christoph said I need to focus on telling you about his book development for now. Maybe later he will train me to understand your messages as well. I hope so ☺️');

        $template = ButtonTemplate::create('Here is how I can help you:')->addButtons([
            ElementButton::create('💌 Edit subscription')->type('postback')->payload('subscribe'),
            ElementButton::create('👉 Christoph\'s Blog')->url('https://christoph-rumpel.com/')
        ]);

        $this->bot->assertTemplate($template, true);
    }
}

```

The bot doesn't know what `What is your name?` means. We haven't implemented it yet, so the fallback message is triggered. Since we return multiple messages in the fallback method, we can also check for multiple ones. This is why we can use multiple `assertReply` methods. This is great for basic test messages. But for template messages we need to check the template with `assertTemplate`. Now run the test with:

 ```bash 
phpunit tests/BotMan/FallbackTest.php
 ```

Everything should be green.

## Subscription Conversation Test

Now we move on the subscription process. Create another test file and name it `SubscribeConversationTest.php`. We will create three tests here. First one, is for the welcome message.

```php
/**
 * @test
 */
public function it_welcomes_user_at_start()
{
	$this->bot->receives('GET_STARTED')
		->assertReply('Hey and welcome! 👋')
		->assertReply('I help Christoph to spread some news about his book development. 📘');
}
```

The bot receives the get_started button payload `GET_STARTED` and we assert two replies. Essentially, the bot sends more than these two replies. But for this test, it's just fine. I want to keep this test as simple as possible. Run it with:

```bash
phpunit tests/BotMan/SubscribeConversationTest.php
```

Besides, we can trigger the other messages with the `subscribe` keyword as well. First we take care of the subscribe process with a positive answer.

```php
/**
 * @test
 **/
public function it_subscribes_a_user()
{
	$this->bot->receives('subscribe')
		->assertReply('I help Christoph to spread some news about his book development. 📘')
		->assertReply('If you like, I can keep you updated about it here on Facebook Messenger.')
		->assertQuestion('Are you in?')
		->receives('yes')
		->assertReply('Woohoo, great to have you on board! 🎉')
		->assertReply('I will message you when there is something new to tell ✌️')
		->assertReply("Christoph also likes to blog a lot. Make sure to check out his site for more chatbot stuff: \n ✨ https://christoph-rumpel.com/ ✨ ")
		->assertReply('See you! 👋');
}
```
Here we listen for the subscribe message, then assert some messages as well as a question. Additionally, we chain another incoming user message and assert the rest of the replies. `yes` is the value of our `Yes please` button. We can just use it as a trigger for the other messages. In order to test the negative reply, let's create another test method.

```php
/**
 * @test
 **/
public function it_unsubscribes_a_user()
{
	$this->bot->receives('subscribe')
		->assertReply('I help Christoph to spread some news about his book development. 📘')
		->assertReply('If you like, I can keep you updated about it here on Facebook Messenger.')
		->assertQuestion('Are you in?')
		->receives('no')
		->assertReply('Ok no problem. If change your mind, just type "subscribe".')
		->assertReply("Christoph also likes to blog a lot. Make sure to check out his site for more chatbot stuff: \n ✨ https://christoph-rumpel.com/ ✨ ")
		->assertReply('See you! 👋');
}
```

It's basically the same, just with the users's negative response and our replies for this case. Now, run the tests again and everything should be green as well.

As you have probably noticed, we had to duplicate the beginning of the subscribe conversation. This is something that bothers me a lot and I am already figuring out with Marcel how to create a better solution. Still, these few tests are very helpful and good examples.


## Conclusion

We are done! Wow, that was quite a journey. I'm glad I could show you a new and real chatbot use case of mine. We covered everything from planning the bot to implementing and testing it. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and it helps you for your next messenger newsletter.
