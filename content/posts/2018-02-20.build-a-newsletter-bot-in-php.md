title: Build a newsletter chatbot in PHP
category: chatbots
summary: E-mail has been a great channel for staying in touch with your audience for years. But times are changing and messengers are taking over communication. Let's see how I used Facebook Messenger to build a little newsletter bot for my upcoming book "Build Chatbots with PHP".
---

## What book?

Since the beginning of the year I am working on a new project of mine. It's a book called [Build Chatbots with PHP](https://christoph-rumpel.com/build-chatbots-with-php). Follow the link to find out what it is about and who it is for.
<br /><br />
More interesting to us is the newsletter. On the [book's landing page](https://christoph-rumpel.com/build-chatbots-with-php) you can sign up for it. About once or twice a month I will send out an e-mail with news on the development of the book and other interesting connected stuff. That's a quite common approach. I can spread the word about my product and you can get a free sample chapter, the latest news and a discount when the product is finished.

## Messengers to the rescue

In the sample chapter I explain how messengers trigger a big shift right now. Of course it is obvious that more and more conversations are digital today, but messengers have a much bigger role here than expected. This also happens at work where Slack and Co. replaces a lot of mails. Messengers provide a new communication channel which is not only interested for private purposes. At of companies already use them as well.
<br /><br />This is why chatbots play a big role in this game. They can bring automated services to a chat. As a result you can reach so many new users when you think about big chats like Facebook Messenger, Telegram or Skype. So instead of sending a traditional e-mail, you can send a message through a messenger as well. This is what we are going to do now.

## The plan

So here is the plan. Next to the traditional newsletter subscription we want to provide another option, that works with a messenger; Facebook Messenger in this case. This messenger has a nice plugin that we can integrate in the landing page. This way the users don't have to leave the landing page while subscribing. Awesome, right? These are the next steps:

* BotMan setup
* Facebook setup
* Test it
* Subscription Conversation
* Website integration

## BotMan setup

The easiest way to install BotMan Studio is via the installer. (skip this if you got that installer already)

```bash
composer global require "botman/installer"
```

After that you can just install a new instance like that:

```bash
botman new newsletter-bot
```

Inside the new directory, we then need to install the Facebook driver. Luckily there is a nice command for that.

```bash
php artisan botman:install-driver facebook
```

In order to connect our BotMan application to a Facebook app, we need to define some environment values. Copy them to you `.env` file. Later we will change the values to the correct ones.

```bash
FACEBOOK_TOKEN=YOUR_APP_FACEBOOK_PAGE_TOKEN
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET
FACEBOOK_VERIFICATION=YOUR_VERIFICATION
```

Ok, so last step here is to create a public URL to your application. I use Laravel valet. It provides a little command to create a temporary public URL to the local application. But you can also use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or an already deployed application. 

```bash
valet share
```


## Facebook setup

I won't cover how to create a Facebook Page or Facebook App here. Check [Build a Facebook Messenger chatbot in Laravel with BotMan Studio 2.0](https://christoph-rumpel.com/2017/09/build-a-facebook-chatbot-with-laravel-and-botman-studio/) or [Build a PHP chatbot in 10 minutes](https://christoph-rumpel.com/2016/08/build-a-php-chatbot-in-10-minutes/) to get more information about that.
<br /><br />
Now go to your Facebook App and grab the tokens. The `App Secret` you can found on the main dashboard. The other two are listed on the Messenger settings page. With `FACEBOOK_TOKEN` BotMan refers to the Facebook Page Access Token. You need to select the Facebook Page in order to get this token.
<br /><br />
Now we are ready to connect the BotMan instance with the Facebook app. Go to the "Webhooks" section inside your Messenger settings. There you can add the webhook. The webhook is the URL where our BotMan application gets the messages from Facebook. Make sure to check the permissions for `messages` and `messaging_postback` in order to make it work. In this section you also have to subscribe to a Facebook page.

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> If you get any errors, take look at my webhook articles <a href="https://christoph-rumpel.com/2017/09/botman-quick-tip-how-to-debug-facebook-webhook-errors">here</a> for debugging tips.</div>

## Test it

To make sure that everything has been setup correctly, let's try it out. Go to your Facebook Page and open the chat. When you send `Hi`, you should get back a reply from your bot. This is one of the given BotMan examples that works out of the box.
<br /><br />
If it doesn't reply, please check your `storage/logs/laravel.log` file for errors.

## Subscription

Let's think about what the bot should be capable of. When the user enters the chat, we want to send him a welcome message and information about the subscription. It should be possible to subscribe and unsubscribe from news on Facebook Messenger. That's enough for now. I want to start with the welcome message.

### Welcome message

In Facebook Messenger there is the concept of a `get_started button`. When you add it, the user will see this button before he can enter the chatbot. This way our application knows when a users enters the chat for the first time and we can react to that. In BotMan Studio we can add the button with a simple command.

```bash
php artisan botman:facebookAddStartButton
```

This will send a HTTP request to Facebook and active our button. You cannot change the text of the button, but the payload. You can define it in your `config/botman/facebook.php` file.

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Facebook Start Button Payload
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| The payload which is sent when the Get Started Button is clicked.
|
*/
'start_button_payload' => 'GET_STARTED_NOW',
```
<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> After editing the payload value you need to use the artisan command again.</div>

The `payload` is what we can listen for in our BotMan route.

```php
$botman->hears('GET_STARTED', function (BotMan $bot) {
    $bot->reply('Welcome!');
});
```

In order to test a get_started button you need to delete the conversation. Then the button will appear again, the next time you enter the conversation.

<img class="blogimage" alt="Screenshot showing how to delete a Facebook Messenger conversation" src="/images/blog/fb_delete_conversation.png" />

Test it out and you should get now the above defined welcome message, after clicking the start button.

## Conversation

In BotMan a conversation class is a place where you can group questions that belongs to each other. Let's create one for our subscription conversation.

```bash
php artisan botman:make:conversation SubscribeConversation
```

You can find this new class here: `/app/Http/Conversations/SubscribeConversation.php`

I always start my conversations with thinking about the different questions.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Conversations;

use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Conversations\Conversation;

class SubscribeConversation extends Conversation
{
    public function run()
    {
        $this->welcome();
    }

    private function welcome()
    {
    }

    private function askAboutSubscription()
    {
    }

}
```

The `run` method will be called first, when you start a conversation. Here we define where to go next. First we will welcome the user with a message and then we'll ask about the subscription. You could do that in one method too, but I like it better that way. There is also another reason. I already know that I want to use this conversation, even if the user is not visiting the bot the first time. So the welcome message only makes sense the first time.
<br ><br />
In the welcome method we want to welcome the user (what a surprise) and trigger the subscription question. There we ask the user if he or she is ok with getting news from time to time about my book.

```php
private function welcome()
{
	$this->bot->reply('Hey and welcome! 👋');
	$this->askAboutSubscription();
}

private function askAboutSubscription()
{
	$this->bot->reply('I help Christoph to spread some news about his book development. 📘');
	$this->bot->reply('If you like, I can keep you updated about it here on Facebook Messenger.');

	$question = Question::create('Are you in?')
		->addButtons([
			Button::create('Yes please')
				->value('yes'),
			Button::create('Nope')
				->value('no'),
		]);

	$this->ask($question, function (Answer $answer) {
		if ($answer->getValue() === 'yes') {
			$this->bot->reply('Wuhu, great to have you on board! 🎉');
			$this->bot->reply('I will message you when there is something new to tell ✌️');
		} else {
			$this->bot->reply('Ok no problem. If change your mind, just type "subscribe".');
		}

		$this->bot->reply("Christoph also likes to blog a lot. Make sure to checkout his site for more chatbot stuff: \n ✨ https://christoph-rumpel.com/ ✨ ");
		$this->bot->reply('See you! 👋');
	});
}
```

It is quite some code, but nothing special here. Take some minutes to read it over and try it out yourself in the chat. You should see the welcome message, the question about the subscription and two options for responding to the answer. Both ways the user also gets a little bye-message with a note about my blog articles.

## Make it reusable 

Right now our conversation only works the when the user starts it with the get_started button. As mentioned in the reply messages, we want the bot to listen for the ext "subscribe" as well. Let's add that in our BotMan route.

```php
$botman->hears('GET_STARTED_NOW|subscribe', function (BotMan $bot) {
    $userFromStartButton = $bot->getMessage()->getText() === 'GET_STARTED_NOW' ? true : false;
    $bot->startConversation(new SubscribeConversation($userFromStartButton));
});
```
Next to the "GET_STARTED" text, we also listen for "subscribe". Both trigger the same action. But as you can see we are adding a boolean to our class constructor. This way we know inside our conversation class, if the user triggered the button or the text message.
<br /><br />
In our conversation we know have the chance to only show the welcome message, if it is new user. To make this possible we need to add a constructor and a class property to check for.

```php
public function __construct(bool $userFromStartButton) {

	$this->userFromStartButton = $userFromStartButton;
}

public function run()
{
	$this->userFromStartButton ? $this->welcome() : $this->askAboutSubscription();
}
```

Now we can trigger the subscribe conversation with the text "subscribe" as well. This way the user is able to unsubscribe if needed.

## Saving subscriptions

You probably have noticed that we aren't storing any user information yet. Yes you're right :-) So let's do that.
We can edit the already given user migration file `database/migrations/..._create_users_table.php` and add the accessible Facebook user data. Depending on the user's permissions, not all values are accessible. We make this values `nullable`.

```php
public function up()
{
	Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
		$table->increments('id');
		$table->string('fb_id');
		$table->string('first_name');
		$table->string('last_name');
		$table->string('profile_pic')->nullable();
		$table->string('locale', 8)->nullable();
		$table->string('gender')->nullable();
		$table->boolean('subscribed')->default(false);
		$table->timestamps();
	});
}
```

Now create the table with `php artisan migrate`. 

<div class="blognote"><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you have setup your database already before.</div>

With that done, we need a place where we add the users. For this purpose I'd like to use a BotMan middleware. Like a Laravel middleware it lets us perform tasks at certain points of the request cycle. For all incoming messages I want to add or update a user. We can use the BotMan `Heard Middleware` for that. It will be called every time a message was matched.
<br /><br />Here is the code.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use App\User;
use BotMan\BotMan\BotMan;
use BotMan\BotMan\Interfaces\Middleware\Heard;
use BotMan\BotMan\Messages\Incoming\IncomingMessage;

class SaveUserMiddleware implements Heard
{
    public function heard(IncomingMessage $message, $next, BotMan $bot)
    {
        $user = $bot->getUser();

        if($user instanceof \BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\User) {
            User::createFromIncomingMessage($user);
        }

        return $next($message);
    }
}
```

Inside the `heard` method we grab the BotMan user object and put it inside a method from our user model. We need to check if the message is from Facebook Messenger. To accomplish it we could check the matched BotMan driver or, like we did, check the user object. Every driver have their own ones.
<br /><br />
And in the user model we update or create the new user.

```php
public static function createFromIncomingMessage(\BotMan\Drivers\Facebook\Extensions\User $user)
{
	$givenUser = User::where('fb_id', $user->getId())
		->first();

	if (! $givenUser) {
		User::updateOrCreate([
			'fb_id' => $user->getId(),
			'first_name' => $user->getFirstName(),
			'last_name' => $user->getLastName(),
			'profile_pic' => $user->getProfilePic(),
			'locale' => $user->getLocale(),
			'gender' => $user->getGender(),
		]);
	}
}
```
Give it a try. Type "subscribe" in the chat and with a little luck, you should get a reply and new entry in your database. If not, check your logs for errors. Also make sure to uncomment the lines responsible for it immediately. This is important because Facebook will send in case of an error the message again and again. The sooner your application responds with a 200 code, the better it is.
