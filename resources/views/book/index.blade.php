                    <p class="mb-4">I'm a chatbot developer and speaker from Vienna. In the last two years I have been building all kinds of chatbots for small and big companies. They were integrated in Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram or on websites with custom solutions.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">For every project I used my favourite programming language PHP. Yes, that's possible. No need to learn another one like NodeJS. PHP is all you need!</p>
